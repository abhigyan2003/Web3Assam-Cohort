# Frontend

## Project overview
This is the frontend for the Assignment1 project — a React single-page application built with Vite. It contains the UI, components, and assets used to interact with the backend/services for the assignment.

## Framework used
- React (with Vite)

## Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16.x
- npm (or yarn)

## Steps to run
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd c:\one\OneDrive\Desktop\abhugyan\Web3Assam-Cohort\Mentees\Abhigyan Borah\Assignment1\frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at the address shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:5173).

4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Preview the production build locally:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Notes
- If the project uses environment variables, add them to a `.env` file in this folder (refer to Vite docs for naming).
- Adjust Node/npm versions if you encounter compatibility issues.
